## Project Overview

Paleontology news aggregator project (early stage). The goal is to collect and aggregate paleontology-related news from academic and scientific RSS feeds.

## Current State

The project is in its initial stage with no build system, language, or framework chosen yet. The only data file is `sources.txt`, which contains RSS feed URLs from:

- **Science** (AAAS) — table of contents feed
- **ScienceDaily** — fossils & ruins section
- **Nature** — general feed + palaeontology subject feed
- **Phys.org** — paleontology section
- **Cambridge University Press** — journal feed
- **Oxford Academic** — journal feed
- **Wiley Online Library** — three journal feeds (likely paleontology-related journals)
